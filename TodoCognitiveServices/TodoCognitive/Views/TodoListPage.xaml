Many allergens are not fully mentioned in the product ingredients list or they are called in a different way, it's a big challenge to identify them and figured out if it's save or not for someone with a specific allergy. Our plan in make people with allergies easier by building a Mobile App which can use their phone cameras to read the product ingredients via code bar or OCR technology and based on that analysis determinate the if there is a risk for that person and their allergies to consume that product. People with intolerance, allergy or sensitive to certain components might rest in our App to have a better assessment of what they can buy at the store or supermarket." />
